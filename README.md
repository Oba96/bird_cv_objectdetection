# bird_cv_objectdetection
Computer vision and object detection techniques 

We were tasked by Autumwatch 2020 to research and develop an implementation plan  for  an  object  detection  system  to  detect  different  bird  species.  In  this  project  were  were required to implement your solution using the TensorFlow Object Detection API 2.0.
